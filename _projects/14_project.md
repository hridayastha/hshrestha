<b>Overview</b><br>
<br><p>This project focuses on understanding the regulation and function of adherens junction proteins, particularly δ-catenin, in cancer progression. Adherens junctions are critical for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and epithelial integrity. Disruption of these junctions is a hallmark of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process driving cancer metastasis.</p>
<p>The δ-catenin protein is a member of the p120-catenin subfamily and has been found to be overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate, lung, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. Previous work has shown that δ-catenin can promote E-cadherin processing and activate oncogenic β-catenin signaling, suggesting an important role for δ-catenin in cancer progression. This project aims to further elucidate the mechanisms by which δ-catenin is regulated and how it contributes to cancer development and metastasis.</p>
<p>The project also investigates the role of other adherens junction proteins, such as E-cadherin and p120-catenin, in modulating δ-catenin function and cancer progression. Understanding the interplay between these proteins and their impact on cell-cell adhesion and signaling pathways will provide important insights into the complex regulation of the adherens junction and its implications in cancer. Overall, this project seeks to uncover novel mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of adherens junction proteins and their contribution to the hallmarks of cancer.</p>

<b> Key Findings<b><br>
<li>δ-Catenin can be degraded by both the proteosomal- and the lysosomal pathways.</li><br>
<li>β-TrCP interacts with δ-catenin and facilitates its degradation via Ub-proteasome.</li><br>
<li>Ubiquitination sites on δ-catenin are mainly located at its Lys1049 and Lys1158.</li><br>
<div style="text-align: justify"><li>Hakai, an E3 ligase for E-cadherin, stabilizes Src, which inhibits the binding between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and δ-catenin. This interaction leads to reduced proteosomal degradation of δ-catenin, resulting in its stabilization.</li></div><br>
