<b>Overview</b><br>
<br><p>The project focuses on the critical role of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) in the progression of mammary cancer, particularly in the context of ERBB2-driven mammary tumors. JAK1 is a protein tyrosine kinase involved in the cytokine-mediated activation of the STAT signaling pathway, which is pivotal in various biological processes including cell growth, survival, and differentiation. This study utilizes genetically engineered mouse models, specifically mammary-specific JAK1 conditional knockout mice, to dissect the role of JAK1 in mammary gland biology and tumorigenesis. By employing a combination of molecular biology techniques, including gene knockout, RNA sequencing, and protein analysis, the research aims to elucidate the mechanistic pathways through which JAK1 influences cancer cell behavior and tumor progression.</p><p>The research methodology integrates both in vitro and in vivo approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of JAK1 function. This includes the generation of JAK1-deficient mammary cancer cell lines and their orthotopic transplantation into mice to study the effects on tumor growth and metastatic spread. Additionally, the project employs advanced imaging techniques to monitor tumor progression and metastasis in live animals. The overarching goal of this research is to validate JAK1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, offering insights into its role in cancer biology and the possibility of developing targeted therapies that could inhibit JAK1-mediated signaling pathways in cancer cells.</p>
