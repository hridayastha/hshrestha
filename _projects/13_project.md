<b>Overview</b>
<br>
δ-Catenin, also referred to as NPRAP, belongs to the p120-catenin subfamily within the armadillo protein family. It has been implicated in dendrogenesis and cognitive functions and is associated with multiple human cancers. Prior studies have demonstrated that δ-catenin plays a role in mediating cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways, particularly in cancers such as prostate and colorectal carcinomas. This research project is directed at investigating the molecular mechanisms governing the ubiquitination of δ-catenin. Ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification that regulates protein degradation; therefore, understanding the ubiquitination process of δ-catenin is vital for elucidating its role in various cellular functions and its involvement in cancer progression, especially concerning epithelial cell adhesion and cancer-associated signaling pathways. This study aims to enhance the broader understanding of δ-catenin's regulatory role in cellular processes and assess its potential as a therapeutic target in oncological treatment.

<b>Key Findings:</b>
<br>
<li>δ-Catenin can be degraded by both the proteosomal- and the lysosomal pathways.</li><br>
<li>β-TrCP interacts with δ-catenin and facilitates its degradation via Ub-proteasome.</li><br>
<li>Ubiquitination sites on δ-catenin are mainly located at its Lys1049 and Lys1158.</li>
