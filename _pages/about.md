*Unraveling the Tapestry of Cancer: Exploring Cells, Genes, and Hope.*

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in <a href="http://www.wagnerlab.net">Wagner's Lab</a> at Wayne State University, USA. I have a broad background in cancer biology with specific training in breast and pancreatic cancer.<br><br>
I received my Ph.D. in Pharmacy (Molecular Pathology) from Chonnam National University, South Korea in 2017. There I gained technical and professional expertise in molecular and cell biology. During my Ph.D. studies, I studied the factors affecting Adherens Junction complexes and assessed the role of the protein δ-catenin in cancer initiation and progression.<br><br>

I joined In Dr. Wagners’s lab in early 2018, as a Postdoctoral Fellow. Since then I have focused my efforts on elucidating the mechanisms regulating the normal development of the mammary gland and pancreas and identifying genetic pathways that control breast and pancreatic cancer development. <br><br>

Currently, my research interest is to study JAK/STAT pathway in cytokine signaling mediated pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer initiation and progression using novel genetically engineered mice models in order to find novel pathways that can be used for the rational development of drugs able to prevent pancreatic cancer or to kill the cancer cells without harming normal pancreas or exerting side effects on other organs.
