*Unraveling the Tapestry of Cancer: Exploring Cells, Genes, and Hope.*

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a former Postdoctoral Research Associate in <a href="http://www.wagnerlab.net">Wagner's Lab</a> at Wayne State University, USA <i>[2018-2024]</i>. I have a broad background in cancer biology with specific training in breast and pancreatic cancer.<br><br>I received my Ph.D. in Pharmacy (Molecular Pathology) from Chonnam National University, South Korea in 2017. There I gained technical and professional expertise in molecular and cell biology. During my Ph.D. studies, I studied the factors affecting Adherens Junction complexes and assessed the role of the protein δ-catenin in cancer initiation and progression.<br><br>

I joined Dr. Kay-Uwe Wagner’s lab in early 2018 as a Postdoctoral Fellow. During my time there, I focused my efforts on elucidating the mechanisms regulating the normal development of the mammary gland and pancreas and identifying genetic pathways that control breast and pancreatic cancer development using genetically engineered mouse models. <br><br>

Following my relocation to Connecticut for a family reunion in mid-2024, I took the opportunity to spend meaningful time with my 4-year-old son. Having dedicated this period to my family, <i><u>I am now seeking new professional opportunities and prepared to advance to the next chapter of my scientific career.</u></i> My primary research interests encompass two areas: cellular signaling in the early development of glandular tissues, inflammatory conditions, and cancer progression, and oncology drug development.
