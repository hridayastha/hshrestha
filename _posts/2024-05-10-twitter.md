description: New research from the WagnerLab is out today in CellReports. Getting this work published in Cell Reports required incredible amount of work (7 main and 17 'supplemental' figures and 5 tables). Take a look and learn the role of JAK1 kinase as a critical signaling mediator of cytokines that promote mutant KRAS-induced pancreatic cancer initiation and progression.
