Welcome to my candid take on the rollercoaster ride that is MDPI journals. If you've been in the academic game for a while, you know the drill. Review requests flood in like it's Black Friday at a discount store. Seriously, my inbox feels like a tidal wave of invitations, and honestly, it can be a bit much. I'm just trying to sift through the chaos and find something worthwhile among the madness.
<br><br>
<b>The Constant Stream of Review Requests</b>
<br><br>
Let‚Äôs talk about the avalanche of review requests. My specialty is in cancer cell signaling, so you can imagine my confusion when I receive requests to review papers on topics like mathematics or engineering. Just because an article mentions "cancer" doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm equipped to assess it. It would be nice if the editors did a little homework on potential reviewers before sending out those invites. I‚Äôm not alone in this sentiment; plenty of my colleagues report getting bombarded with review requests from both MDPI and Frontiers journals that are totally outside their areas of expertise.
<br><br>
I haven‚Äôt reviewed anything for Frontiers yet, but I‚Äôve received countless invitations to be a guest editor for special issues. I won‚Äôt dive too deep into Frontiers here, but I do have a bone to pick regarding one particularly outrageous use of AI in an article they published. It‚Äôs a reminder that responsibility lies not only with reviewers but also with editors.
I‚Äôve found myself hitting ‚Äúdecline‚Äù more often than I‚Äôd like to admit. Seriously, how many times can you press that button before it starts feeling like a personal rejection? But hey, every now and then, a title or abstract piques my interest, and I think, ‚ÄúMaybe this time it'll be different.‚Äù Spoiler alert: it usually isn‚Äôt.
<br><br></div>
<b>The Frustration Factor</b>
>You know what's really frustrating? The sinking feeling when you reject a paper only to find out later that it got published anyway. It's like shouting into an empty room‚Äîtotally disheartening. This experience has definitely made me less enthusiastic about contributing to their review process. In fact, I made a New Year‚Äôs resolution (and I‚Äôm actually sticking to it!) to stop reviewing for MDPI altogether. üòÇ

A lot of my colleagues feel similarly. We seem to be part of an unspoken club of MDPI reviewers who just want to escape the madness. It‚Äôs exhausting to see consistently low-quality submissions slipping through the cracks.
<br><br>
If you‚Äôve taken a peek at Reddit discussions about these journals, you‚Äôll find stories of folks receiving review requests for papers that appear to be generated by AI‚Äîso bizarre they‚Äôre hard to believe. These kinds of articles drain our energy faster than a long day filled with Western blots.
Speaking of AI-generated papers, there was this one article published in Frontiers early in 2024 about spermatogonial stem cells and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The figures were filled with nonsensical AI-generated images. Although they eventually retracted it, it raises significant questions about the state of academic publishing today. Many people agree that quality control is lacking, and it‚Äôs clear that some publications are just spam. If you're curious, there are certainly discussions about this paper floating around on Reddit where others are chiming in.
<br><br>
<b>An Eye-Opening Experience</b>
<br><br>
Just this morning while I was writing this blog post, I got an email from Web of Science letting me know that a paper I reviewed for Biomolecules (another MDPI journal) was published in September. This was the same paper I reviewed back in early August and had serious doubts about its novelty due to major flaws. Normally, I‚Äôm all for giving authors a chance, so I suggested substantial revisions instead of outright rejection.
<br><br>
If you're familiar with MDPI's reviewer portal, you know that after submitting your review, you can see other reviewers' comments‚Äîbut only anonymously. To my surprise, I was the only reviewer for that paper! Based on my feedback, I figured the editor would reject it without hesitation. Instead, I got an invitation to review the revised version.
<br><br>
Now, guess how many days after my initial review submission that invitation came? If you‚Äôre thinking two months or even six months, think again. The authors only took a few days to address my concerns, and their responses were incredibly superficial‚Äîno new experiments were conducted, just a few minor typo fixes.
<br><br>
I planned to decline the revised manuscript, but before I could submit my review, the editor emailed me saying they wanted to cancel my invitation ‚Äúto advance the progress of the manuscript.‚Äù They accepted the paper without waiting for my feedback! Now there's another reviewer listed in the published paper who had very minor comments about typos. Do you think Reviewer 2 really exists, or was it someone from the editorial board?
<br><br>
While we‚Äôre on the topic of frustrations with MDPI's editorial practices, let me mention a couple of times when they‚Äôve sent me review requests for manuscripts that had incomplete abstracts. I emailed them pointing out that sending out requests without ensuring something as fundamental as an abstract is complete is unacceptable. Guess what? Crickets! No response whatsoever. All these incidents definitely raise questions about quality control at MDPI journals.
<br><br>
<b>The Quality Quandary</b>
<br><br>
Now let‚Äôs get into the nitty-gritty regarding the quality of papers published by MDPI. Sure, some researchers have put out decent work there. But let‚Äôs be real: there‚Äôs also a lot of downright terrible stuff floating around. I‚Äôve read papers that made me question how they even passed a review process‚Äîone friend even joked that reading an MDPI paper felt more like slogging through a party-loving undergrad's last-minute assignment than actual research.
<br><br>
Then there are those who swear by MDPI for its speedy turnaround times. For PhD candidates desperate for that first-author paper to graduate, MDPI or Frontiers might seem like a godsend. But let‚Äôs pause and ask ourselves: what does that say about the quality of research being published? It feels like we‚Äôre sacrificing depth for speed‚Äîa risky gamble if you ask me.
<br><br>
<b>Perspectives from Peers</b>
<br><br>
When chatting with peers about MDPI, opinions run the gamut. Some see it as a predatory publisher simply chasing profits at the expense of quality. This sentiment pops up frequently in conversations about the sheer volume of low-effort articles making their way into print. A few friends have even likened reading an MDPI paper to doing more work than went into writing it! Ouch.
<br><br>
And then there‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúpublish or perish‚Äù culture in academia that forces people to consider MDPI as a viable option. Ironically, many researchers feel cornered into publishing in journals that don‚Äôt necessarily uphold high standards just to meet tenure requirements or degree criteria. As one mentor put it succinctly: ‚ÄúIf I see a paper published in MDPI, I assume it‚Äôs not worth my time.‚Äù That kind of judgment can seriously hurt early-career researchers trying to beef up their CVs.
<br><br>
<b>Navigating Academic Publishing</b>
<br><br>
So where does that leave us? At the end of the day, MDPI feels like this ambiguous space in academic publishing. Some love the quick publication times and see it as an excellent way to disseminate their work. Others view it as a dumpster fire where low-quality research goes to die. Personally? I'm leaning towards avoiding them like they‚Äôre contagious.
<br><br</div>

>Frontiers and MDPI were once classified as possible predatory publishers by Jeffrey Beall‚Äîa list that has since been taken offline amid controversy. For early-career researchers, this situation complicates matters further. Associating with lower-tier journals can raise eyebrows during job hunts or when vying for tenure spots. The choices you make regarding where to publish can have lasting impacts on your career trajectory.

<b>Final Thoughts</b>
<br><br>
In this wild world of academia, it's crucial we keep discussing where we publish and why it matters so much. The pressure to publish can be intense, but choosing quality over speed should be our priority if we want to maintain the integrity of our work.
<br><br>
So here‚Äôs my advice: if something feels off about a journal‚Äîlike MDPI or Frontiers‚Äîtrust your instincts. Plenty of reputable alternatives exist that may take longer but will ultimately serve your career better in the long run. Let‚Äôs advocate for higher standards in academic publishing together and make informed decisions about where we share our research. After all, our work deserves respect and recognition!
